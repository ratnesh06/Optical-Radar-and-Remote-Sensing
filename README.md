## Optical Sensing of Urban Landscape and Traffic Congestion
This work introduces a method combining Adaptive Background Subtraction and Optical Flow to enhance traffic congestion detection and land cover change monitoring using vehicular-mounted cameras. Our approach aims to refine data accuracy and processing efficiency. The algorithm merges these techniques to provide real-time, detailed analysis. The findings indicate a marked improvement in identifying and tracking dynamic objects, offering significant implications for urban planning and environmental management.

## Introduction:
Urban landscapes are dynamic, ever-evolving ecosystems that pose significant challenges for monitoring and understanding their changes over time. Rapid urbanization, coupled with technological advancements, necessitates innovative approaches to keep pace with the transforming cityscapes. This project presents one such approach, leveraging the power of computer vision and remote sensing to monitor urban environments.
We focus on two key facets of urban change: vehicle movement and land cover alterations. These elements are not only indicative of a city's day-to-day activities but also reflect broader trends in urban development and planning. Tracking these changes can provide valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers alike. To achieve this, we employ three specific computer vision techniques: Adaptive Background Subtraction, Optical Flow, and Foreground Masking. These methodologies, when combined, offer a robust framework for detecting and tracking changes in urban landscapes.
Through this project, we aim to demonstrate the potential of our system as a powerful tool for urban monitoring. The results, as we will discuss, show promising precision in detecting changes over time, underscoring the value of such an approach in the field of remote sensing.
